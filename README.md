# UnWasted: A Relief Platform to Reduce Food Waste

UnWasted is an innovative project that aims to stop wasting surplus food and deliver it quickly and efficiently to those in need. Millions of tons of food are wasted every year, while many people struggle with hunger. UnWasted set out to address these issues and use the world's food resources more sustainably.

UnWasted works very similar to the YemekSepeti app.  People who have surplus products put their products in the advertisement, then people in need add the product to the cart from the advertisement page and get the product.

## Used Technologies

React, Node.js , Boostrap
The project is basically written in React and Node.js with some npm packages added. Boostrap was used for style.
In the front-end part, props, component, axios(get,post,delete,put), hooks etc. features are used.

### `npm start`
1- npm i
2- npm run dev
3- npm start


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
